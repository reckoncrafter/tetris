## TODO

  - > Perhaps I should've used vectors...
- [x] Fix the bug that causes blocks to stop falling
- [x] Add end game state
- [x] Add block sliding
- [x] Add correct tetromino alignments
- [ ] Add tetris standard drop order
- [ ] Prevent rotation from causing clipping (offset bumping)
- [ ] Add color graphics
- [ ] Add game acceleration
- [ ] Support Windows 🪟

## Installation (but why would you want that?)
:warning: Because of the termios.h library, this software only runs on Linux 🐧.
A windows compatible version is planned if possible.

```sh
git clone https:://github.com/reckoncrafter/tetris.git
cd tetris
make
```
